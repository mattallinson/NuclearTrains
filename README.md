## Introduction

Using real-time open data from network rail via the Real Time Trains API, Nuclear Trains is a twitter bot that tweets when a freight train departs a nuclear power plant: including a link detailing its time and position.

Trains are not guaranteed to be pulling nuclear waste flasks, and even if they are, the flasks may or may not be full.

**This project has no stance on nuclear energy, and its main objective is to provide a quantitative and real-time source of information about the movement of nuclear waste in the UK.**

Any more features/whatnot you can tweet at us or raise an issue here.
