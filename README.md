# NuclearTrains

Using real-time open data from network rail, Nuclear Trains is a twitter bot that tweets when a freight train departs a nuclear power plant: including a link detailing its time and position.

Trains are not guaranteed to be pulling nuclear waste flasks, and even if they are, the flasks may or may not be full.

**This project has no stance on nuclear energy, and its main objective is to provide a quantitative and real-time source of information about the movement of nuclear waste in the UK.**

### Project goals
1. To make a twitter bot that live-tweets when a nuclear waste carrying train is running, and a link to its route
2. Set up the website https://nucleartrains.wordpress.com/ and the twitter account https://twitter.com/nucleartrains
 * _Done_  

### Longterm goals
Make a google map that shows the loaction of all nuclear waste trains in real time
