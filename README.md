# NuclearTrains

Using real-time open data from network rail, Nuclear Trains is a twitter bot that tweets when a freight train departs a nuclear power plant: including a link detailing its time and position.

Trains are not guaranteed to be pulling nuclear waste flasks, and even if they are, the flasks may or may not be full.

**This project has no stance on nuclear energy, and its main objective is to provide a quantitative and real-time source of information about the movement of nuclear waste in the UK.**

Slightly more information is available on our [website](http://nucleartrains.co.uk) and you can see the end result on our twitter [@nuclearTrains](https://twitter.com/nucleartrains)

~~Currently the code doesn't take into account if the train is running ahead or behind schedule when it posts the tweets. This is something we're working on. ~~
UPDATE: We're now *reasonably* realtime, and can keep up with trains that run early or late!
